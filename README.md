# cxx-components
This is a number of CXX components for ESP-IDF which bridge C-based SDK
APIs to have an easier CXX interface.

### homekit
The HomeKit bridge is pretty straightforward to use, however it does 
require `esp-homekit-sdk` as an `EXTRA_COMPONENT`. One day I will figure
out how to make this a subdependency of these components, but for now, 
clone in seperately.
